#  SIR Model Simulation

This project simulates the spread of infectious diseases using the **SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered)** mathematical model integrated with **C#**.

##  Project Overview
The SIR model is based on differential equations that represent how diseases spread and recover in a population.  
This project visualizes the process and allows parameter adjustments to observe different outcomes.

##  Technologies Used
- C#
- Differential Equations
- Visual Studio
- .NET Framework

##  Features
- Adjustable infection/recovery rates  
- Dynamic graph generation  
- Real-time data visualization
